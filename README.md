## SCORM Again
This project was created to modernize the SCORM JavaScript runtime, and to provide a stable, tested platform for running AICC, SCORM 1.2, and SCORM 2004 modules. This module is designed to be LMS agnostic, and is written to be able to be run without a backing LMS, logging all function calls and data instead of committing, if an LMS endpoint is not configured.

### What is this not?
1. This is not an LMS
1. This does not handle the uploading and verification of SCORM/AICC modules
1. This project does not **currently** support the TinCan/xAPI runtime, but is it something I am considering in the very near future.
1. This project is __NOT__ complete!!
